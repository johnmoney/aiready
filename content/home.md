hero_headline: Prepare students for **AI Driven Careers** with Clarity
hero_content: |-
  **Because the old way of choosing majors and careers no longer works**

  The AI Ready Institute helps schools, students, and families make decisions that reflect current economic reality—not inherited assumptions.
